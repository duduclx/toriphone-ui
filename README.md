# toriphone ui

This project is an alternative to Wazo-ui.

It uses vite, React and Chakra-ui.

As a community project, we all need your time and work to make it works.

Keep in mind, the project is just starting, and is not my priority right now.

It's actually look like Wazo-ui, but it's not the plan.

We have to rethink the whole interface.
